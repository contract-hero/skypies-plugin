#
# skypies-mcp-launch.sh — find the skypies app and exec the MCP server it ships.
#
# The plugin is a companion to the skypies Mac app. The app bundles the
# server at skypies.app/Contents/MacOS/skypies-mcp, signed with the app, so the
# server and the app always come from the same build. Nothing is downloaded.
#
# Resolution order:
#
#   1. $SKYPIES_MCP_BIN              — explicit override (a dev build).
#   2. /Applications, ~/Applications — the usual install places.
#   3. Spotlight, by bundle id       — the app installed somewhere else.
#
# Anything on stdout would corrupt the MCP stdio stream, so every message goes
# to stderr, which Claude Code captures as MCP server logs.
#
# `skypies-mcp-launch.sh hook <event>` runs the server's hook subcommand for
# hooks/hooks.json. A hook fires on every Read in every session, so in hook
# mode the launcher never logs and a missing app means silence and exit 0.
